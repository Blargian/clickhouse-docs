ClickHouse Cloud is suitable for use as both a **primary data store** and as an **analytics 
layer**.

ClickHouse's columnar architecture, vectorized processing, and cloud-native design 
make it uniquely suited for analytical workloads that require both speed and scale.
Broadly, the most common use cases for ClickHouse Cloud are:

| Use case                                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                           |

| [Real-Time analytics](/cloud/get-started/cloud/use-cases/real-time-analytics)                | ClickHouse Cloud excels at real-time analytics by delivering sub-second query responses on billions of rows through its columnar storage architecture and vectorized execution engine. The platform handles high-throughput data ingestion of millions of events per second while enabling direct queries on raw data without requiring pre-aggregation. Materialized Views provide real-time aggregations and pre-computed results, while approximate functions for quantiles and counts deliver instant insights perfect for interactive dashboards and real-time decision making.|
| [Data Lake and Warehouse](/cloud/get-started/cloud/use-cases/data_lake_and_warehouse)        | As a modern data warehouse solution, ClickHouse Cloud combines native cloud storage integration with S3, GCS, and Azure Blob for cost-effective storage with schema-on-read flexibility that supports semi-structured data like JSON and nested types. The platform achieves massive compression ratios of 10:1 or better, significantly reducing storage costs, while its compute-storage separation architecture allows independent scaling and cost optimization. Users benefit from a standard SQL interface enhanced with advanced analytics functions, making it easy to query and analyze data at any scale.|
| [Observability](/cloud/get-started/cloud/use-cases/observability)                            | ClickHouse Cloud is purpose-built for observability workloads, featuring specialized engines and functions optimized for time-series data that can ingest and query terabytes of logs, metrics, and traces with ease. Through ClickStack, ClickHouse's comprehensive observability solution, organizations can break down the traditional three silos of logs, metrics, and traces by unifying all observability data in a single platform, enabling correlated analysis and eliminating the complexity of managing separate systems. This unified approach makes it ideal for application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, and security event analysis at enterprise scale, with ClickStack providing the tools and integrations needed for complete observability workflows without data silos.|
| [Machine Learning and GenAI](/cloud/get-started/cloud/use-cases/machine_learning_and_gen_ai) | ClickHouse Cloud powers modern AI applications through four key capabilities: native vector similarity search for RAG applications and embedding storage, comprehensive feature store functionality for real-time ML feature engineering and serving, specialized LLM observability for tracking model performance and usage patterns, and integrated MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support that enables AI agents and LLMs to directly query and analyze data. This unified platform eliminates the complexity of managing separate systems for vector databases, feature stores, and observability tools, providing a single solution for the entire AI/ML data pipeline with ClickHouse's signature performance and scalability.|
