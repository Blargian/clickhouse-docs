## What is the backup policy, and what backups, if any, are included?

All services will default to one backup with the new Pricing tiers. Users who need additional backups can do so by configuring additional backups under the settings tab of the Cloud Console. No free backups are included in the new pricing.

## What happens to current configurations that users have set up separate from default backups?

Customer specific backup configurations will carry over.  Users can change these as they see fit in the new tiers.

## Are backups charged differently across tiers?

The cost of backups is the same across all tiers.
