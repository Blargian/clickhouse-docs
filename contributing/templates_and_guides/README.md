# Templates and Guides

In this directory you will find templates and writing guides that you can use when contributing new documentation to the repo.

## Why templates and guides?

At ClickHouse we believe that high quality documentation is vitally important to our community as it helps them get the most
out of ClickHouse quickly. We also recognise that documentation at ClickHouse is a collective effort, with a diverse range of 
people contributing content, not all of whom are technical writers. Fortunately, you don't have to be one to still contribute
great documentation. In this directory you'll find templates and guidelines for various types of content. We use these to help
ensure that our documentation is consistent, and therefore more readable and maintainable, and also to assist you in writing 
quality content for the documentation.
