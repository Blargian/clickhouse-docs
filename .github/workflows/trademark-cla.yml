              marketing, sales, and product materials for Company products. 
              "Partner Trademarks" mean Your employer's name and any employer 
              brand features (e.g., logo) you submit to the Company in connection with your
              Contribution.
              2. Legal authority. You represent that you are legally entitled to

              ii. You may revoke this license at any time upon thirty (30) days'
                  written notice to the Company, after which the Company shall use
                  commercially reasonable efforts to cease all further public
                  use of the Partner Trademarks (but may maintain uses in archived

              iii. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it does not own the 
                   Partner Trademarks and that all goodwill derived from the use 
                   of the Partner Trademarks inures solely to benefit of the

              iv. The Company shall use the Partner Trademarks in a professional
                  manner consistent with industry standards and shall not use 
                  them in any way that would reasonably be expected to diminish 
                  their value or harm the reputation of the Partner Trademarks' 
                  owner(s). The Company's use of Partner Trademarks shall not 
                  imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation beyond the
