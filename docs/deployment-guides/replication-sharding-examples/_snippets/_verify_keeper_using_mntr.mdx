The `mntr` command is also commonly used to verify that ClickHouse Keeper is
running and to get state information about the relationship of the three Keeper nodes.
In the configuration used in this example, there are three nodes working together.
The nodes will elect a leader, and the remaining nodes will be followers.

The `mntr` command gives information related to performance, and whether a particular
node is a follower or a leader.

:::tip
You may need to install `netcat` in order to send the `mntr` command to Keeper.
Please see the [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/ncat/) page for download information.

Run the command below from a shell on `clickhouse-keeper-01`, `clickhouse-keeper-02`, and
`clickhouse-keeper-03` to check the status of each Keeper node. The command
for `clickhouse-keeper-01` is shown below:

```bash
docker exec -it clickhouse-keeper-01  /bin/sh -c 'echo mntr | nc 127.0.0.1 9181'
```
