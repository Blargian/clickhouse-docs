# Take a backup or restore a backup from the UI {#ui-experience}

## AWS

### Taking backups to AWS {#aws}

#### Steps to follow in AWS {#aws-steps}

Follow the steps below on your AWS account:

<VerticalStepper headerLevel="h5">

##### Create an S3 bucket {#create-s3-bucket}

Create an AWS S3 bucket in your account where you want to export backups.

##### Create an IAM role {#create-iam-role}

Create an IAM role that ClickHouse Cloud service will be able to assume into,
to write to this bucket - for role-based authentication:

* a. For this role, you will need to update the IAM role trust policy to include
  the following statement:

    ```json
    "Statement": [
    {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::463754717262:role/CH-S3-bordeaux-ar-90-ue2-29-Role"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    },
   ```
* b. The ARN in this case is obtained from the ClickHouse Cloud service settings
  page which looks similar to this:

<Image img={arn} alt="AWS S3 ARN" size="lg" />

##### Update permissions for role {#update-permissions-for-role}

You will also need to update the permissions for this role so this ClickHouse
Cloud service can write to the S3 bucket. This is done by including a JSON similar
to this one in the role permissions:

```json
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
     {
         "Action": [
             "s3:GetBucketLocation",
             "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::testchbackups"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow"
     },
     {
         "Action": [
             "s3:Get*",
             "s3:List*",
             "s3:PutObject",
             "s3:DeleteObject"
         ],
         "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::testchbackups/*"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow"
     }
 ]
}
```

</VerticalStepper>

#### Steps to follow in ClickHouse Cloud {#cloud-steps}

Follow the steps below in the ClickHouse Cloud console to configure the external bucket:

<VerticalStepper headerLevel="h5">

##### Change external backup {#configure-external-bucket}

On the “Settings” page, click on `Change external backup`

<Image img={change_external_backup} alt="Change external backup" size="lg" />

##### Configure AWS IAM Role ARN and S3 bucket details {#configure-aws-iam-role-arn-and-s3-bucket-details}

On the next screen provide the AWS IAM Role ARN and S3 bucket details:

<Image img={configure_arn_s3_details} alt="Configure AWS IAM Role ARN and S3 bucket details" size="lg" />

##### Save changes {#save-changes}

Click on “Save External Bucket” to save the settings

##### Changing the backup schedule from the default schedule {#changing-the-backup-schedule}

External Backups will now happen in your bucket on the default schedule.
Alternatively, you can configure the backup schedule from the “Settings” page.
If configured differently, the custom schedule is used to write backups to your
bucket and the default schedule (backups every 24 hours) is used for backups in
the ClickHouse cloud owned bucket.

##### View backups stored in your bucket {#view-backups-stored-in-your-bucket}

The Backups page should display these backups in your bucket in a separate table
as shown below:

<Image img={view_backups} alt="View backups stored in your bucket" size="lg" />

</VerticalStepper>

### Restoring backups from AWS {#restoring-backups-from-aws}

Follow the steps below to restore backups from AWS:

<VerticalStepper headerLevel="h5">

##### Create a new service to restore to {#create-new-service-to-restore-to}

Create a new service to restore the backup to.  Currently, we only support
restoring a backup into a new service.

##### Add service ARN {#add-service-arn}

Add the newly created service’s ARN (from the service settings page in Clickhouse
Cloud console) to the trust policy for the IAM role. This is the same as the
[second step](#create-iam-role) in the AWS Steps section above. This is required
so the new service can access the S3 bucket.

##### Get SQL command used to restore backup {#obtain-sql-command-to-restore-backup}

Click on the “access or restore a backup” link above the list of backups in the
UI to get the SQL command to restore the backup. The command should look like
the one shown below, and you can pick the appropriate backup from the dropdown
to get the restore command for that specific backup:

<Image img={backup_command} alt="Get SQL command used to restore backup" size="lg" />

##### Run the restore command {#run-the-restore-command}

Run the restore command from the SQL console in the newly created service to
restore the backup.

</VerticalStepper>

## GCP {#gcp}

### Taking backups to GCP {#gcp-steps}

Follow the steps below to take backups to GCP:

#### Steps to follow in GCP {#gcp-steps}

##### Create a GCP storage bucket {#create-a-gcp-storage-bucket}

Create a storage bucket in your GCP account to export backups.

##### Generate an HMAC Key and Secret {#generate-an-hmac-key-and-secret}

Generate an HMAC Key and Secret, which is required for password-based authentication. Follow the steps belowto generate the keys:

* a. Create a service account
  * I.  Navigate to the IAM & Admin section in the Google Cloud Console and select Service Accounts.
  * II. Click Create Service Account, provide a name and ID, and click Create and Continue.
  * III. Grant the necessary roles for Cloud Storage access (e.g., Storage Object Admin or more granular roles like 
    Storage Object Creator and Storage Object Viewer) to this service account.
  * IV. Click Done to finalize the service account creation.

* b. Generate the HMAC key
  * I. Go to Cloud Storage in the Google Cloud Console, and select `Settings`
  * II Go to the Interoperability tab.
  * III. In the `Service account HMAC` section, click Create a key for a service account.
  * IV. Choose the service account you created in the previous step from the dropdown menu.
  * V. Click Create key.

* c. Securely store the credentials:
  * I. The system will display the Access ID (your HMAC key) and the Secret (your HMAC secret). Save these values, as 
       the secret will not be displayed again after you close this window.
