# Aggregate Function Combinator examples 

In this section of the docs you can find examples for the most commonly used
aggregate combinator functions which are formed by appending any of the
[aggregate function combinators](/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/combinators)
to the [aggregate functions](/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference) to
change their behavior. As the number of possible such aggregate combinator 
functions is very large, we've selected only the most commonly used ones.
