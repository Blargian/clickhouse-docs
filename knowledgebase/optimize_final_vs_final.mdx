# What is the difference between `OPTIMIZE FINAL` and `FINAL`?

`OPTIMIZE FINAL` is a DDL command that physically and permanently reorganizes
and optimizes data on disk. It physically merges data parts in `MergeTree` tables,
performing data deduplication in the process by removing duplicate rows from storage.

`FINAL` is a **query-time** modifier that provides deduplicated results without
changing the structure of the stored data. It works by performing merge logic at
read-time. It is temporary, only affecting the current query result.

Users are often advised to avoid using `OPTIMIZE FINAL`, as it has a significant
performance overhead, however they should not confuse the two. It is often necessary
to use `FINAL` to get back results without duplicates, especially when using table
engines like `ReplacingMergeTree` which may contain duplicate rows which have not
been replaced during the eventual, background merge process.

The table below summarises the key differences:

|Aspect	           |`OPTIMIZE FINAL`                            | `FINAL`                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|Type              | DDL Command                                | Query Modifier                                     |
|Effect            | Permanent storage optimization	            | Temporary query-time deduplication                 |
|Performance       | Impact	High cost once, then faster queries	| Lower individual cost, but repeated for each query |
|Data Modification | Yes - physically changes storage           | No - read-only operation                           |
|Use Case          | Periodic maintenance/optimization          | Real-time deduplicated queries                     |

## When to use each {#when-to-use-each}

Use `OPTIMIZE FINAL` when:

- You want to permanently improve query performance
- You can afford the one-time optimization cost
- You're doing periodic table maintenance
- You want to physically clean up duplicate data

Use `FINAL` when:

- You need deduplicated results immediately
- You can't wait for or don't want permanent optimization
- You only occasionally need deduplicated data
- You're working with frequently changing data

Both are valuable tools, but they serve different purposes in ClickHouse's deduplication strategy.
