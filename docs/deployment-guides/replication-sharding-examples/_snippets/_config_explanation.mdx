- The `config.d` directory contains ClickHouse server configuration file `config.xml`,
  in which custom configuration for each ClickHouse node is defined. This
  configuration gets combined with the default `config.xml` ClickHouse configuration
  file that comes with every ClickHouse installation.
- The `users.d` directory contains user configuration file `users.xml`, in which
  custom configuration for users is defined. This configuration gets combined with
  the default ClickHouse `users.xml` configuration file that comes with every
  ClickHouse installation.

:::tip Custom configuration directories
It is a best practice to make use of the `config.d` and `users.d` directories when
writing your own configuration, rather than directly modifying the default configuration
in `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml` and `etc/clickhouse-server/users.xml`.

The line

```xml
<clickhouse replace="true">
```

Ensures that the configuration sections defined in the `config.d` and `users.d`
directories override the default configuration sections defined in the default
`config.xml` and `users.xml` files.
