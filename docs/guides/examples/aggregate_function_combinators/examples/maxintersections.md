# maxIntersections Combinator Examples

The following combinators can be applied to the `maxIntersections` function:

### maxIntersectionsIf
Calculates maximum intersections only for rows that match the given condition.

### maxIntersectionsArray
Calculates maximum intersections from elements in the array.

### maxIntersectionsMap
Calculates maximum intersections for each key in the map separately.

### maxIntersectionsSimpleState
Returns the maximum intersections value with SimpleAggregateFunction type.

### maxIntersectionsState
Returns the intermediate state of maximum intersections calculation.

### maxIntersectionsMerge
Combines intermediate states to get the final maximum intersections value.

### maxIntersectionsMergeState
Combines intermediate states but returns an intermediate state.

### maxIntersectionsForEach
Calculates maximum intersections for corresponding elements in multiple arrays.

### maxIntersectionsDistinct
Calculates maximum intersections using distinct values only.

### maxIntersectionsOrDefault
Returns 0 if there are no rows to calculate intersections.

### maxIntersectionsOrNull
Returns NULL if there are no rows to calculate intersections.
