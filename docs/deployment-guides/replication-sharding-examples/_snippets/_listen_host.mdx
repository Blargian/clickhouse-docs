External communication to the network interface is enabled by activating the listen
host setting. This ensures that the ClickHouse server host is reachable by other
hosts:

```xml
<listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>
```

The port for the HTTP API is set to `8123`:

```xml
<http_port>8123</http_port>
```

The TCP port for interaction by ClickHouse's native protocol between clickhouse-client
and other native ClickHouse tools, and clickhouse-server and other clickhouse-servers
is set to `9000`:

```xml
<tcp_port>9000</tcp_port>
```
