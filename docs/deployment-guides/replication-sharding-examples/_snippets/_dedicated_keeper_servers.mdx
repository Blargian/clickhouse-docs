:::note
Although it is possible to run ClickHouse Server and ClickHouse Keeper combined on the same server,
we strongly recommend using *dedicated* hosts for ClickHouse keeper in production environments,
which is the approach we will demonstrate in this example.

Keeper servers can be smaller, and 4GB RAM is generally enough for each Keeper server
until your ClickHouse Servers grow large.
