| [Query optimization guide](/optimize/query-optimization)                        | Start here for query optimization fundamentals, covering common scenarios and performance techniques to improve query execution speed.                           |
| [Primary indexes advanced guide](/guides/best-practices/sparse-primary-indexes) | Deep dive into ClickHouse's unique sparse primary indexing system, how it differs from traditional databases, and best practices for optimal indexing strategies. |
| [Query parallelism](/optimize/query-parallelism)                                | Learn how ClickHouse parallelizes query execution using processing lanes and `max_threads` settings, including how to inspect and optimize parallel execution.   |
| [Partitioning key](/optimize/partitioning-key)                                  | Master partition key selection to dramatically improve query performance by enabling efficient data segment pruning and avoiding common partitioning pitfalls.   |
| [Data skipping indexes](/optimize/skipping-indexes)                             | Apply secondary indexes strategically to skip irrelevant data blocks and accelerate filtered queries on non-primary key columns.                                 |
| [`PREWHERE` optimization](/optimize/prewhere)                                   | Understand how `PREWHERE` automatically reduces I/O by filtering data before reading unnecessary columns, plus how to monitor its effectiveness.                 |
| [Bulk inserts](/optimize/bulk-inserts)                                          | Maximize ingestion throughput and reduce resource overhead by batching data insertions effectively.                                                              |
| [Asynchronous inserts](/optimize/asynchronous-inserts)                          | Improve insert performance by leveraging server-side batching to reduce client-side complexity and increase throughput for high-frequency insertions.            |
| [Avoid mutations](/optimize/avoid-mutations)                                    | Design append-only workflows that eliminate costly `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations while maintaining data accuracy and performance.                             |
| [Avoid nullable columns](/optimize/avoid-nullable-columns)                      | Reduce storage overhead and improve query performance by using default values instead of nullable columns where possible.                                        |
| [Avoid `OPTIMIZE FINAL`](/optimize/avoidoptimizefinal)                          | Understand when you should and should not use `OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL`                                    |
| [Analyzer](/operations/analyzer)                                                | Leverage ClickHouse's new query analyzer to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize query execution plans for better efficiency.                           |
| [Query profiling](/operations/optimizing-performance/sampling-query-profiler)   | Use the sampling query profiler to analyze query execution patterns, identify performance hotspots, and optimize resource usage.                                 |
| [Query cache](/operations/query-cache)                                          | Accelerate frequently executed `SELECT` queries by enabling and configuring ClickHouse's built-in query result caching.                                          |
| [Testing hardware](/operations/performance-test)                                | Run ClickHouse performance benchmarks on any server without installation to evaluate hardware capabilities. (Not applicable to ClickHouse Cloud)                 |
